## :house: Introduction

Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the healthcare field is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that focuses on identifying and categorizing named entities within textual data related to healthcare, such as electronic health records (EHRs), medical literature, clinical notes, and patient reports. Named entities typically include entities like diseases, symptoms, medications, procedures, anatomical terms, and medical concepts.
